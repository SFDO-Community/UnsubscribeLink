# Unsubscribe Link by Jessie Rymph
Send an email to anyone from inside Salesforce and include an unsubscribe link right in the email! This app will find all contacts and leads with that email address and mark them “Email opt out.” It will also create an Unsubscribe (custom object) object so you can track unsubscribes over time.
